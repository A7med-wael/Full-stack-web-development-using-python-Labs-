    <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
        <strong style="color: green;">My name is Ahmed Wael.</strong><br>
        I am a student at the Faculty of Computers and Information, Minia University.
        I'm currently in my third year, and my major is <em>Cyber Security</em>.

    <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        I have a strong interest in programming, web development, and ethical hacking.
        I have studied languages such as <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>,
        and I am now training in <span style="color: darkred;">Web Penetration Testing</span>.

        I participated in several competitions such as <u>ECPC</u> and worked with Enactus Minya, where our team won an
        African-level award.
        I'm passionate about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">self-learning</span>, teamwork, and continuous
        improvement.
